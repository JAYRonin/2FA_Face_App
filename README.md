# Secret Notes
The aim of this work was to design and program such a system. Methods of access authorization are password and face biometrics. 
The project was created in accordance with the assumptions set by the PSD2 directive, which focuses on improving the security of payment services. The system is also adapted to the requirements of the RODO regulation, as it uses biometric features of the user. Compliance with the assumptions ensures that it can be widely available and widely used.

The system was implemented in an application called "Secret Notes", which was created to demonstrate its operation. The main functionality of Secret Notes is to store secret user notes. The system can be separated from the application and used in microservice environments. Thanks to this, the scalability of the project is not limited to a single application, providing enormous potential for its development.
